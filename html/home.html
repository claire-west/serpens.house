                <h4>Logistical Partnership with A.C.R.E.</h4>
                <img src="static/GROW.jpg" />
                <p>A.C.R.E. G.R.O.W. is an after-school program for children, which provides them with many important services and helps nurture their skills. The Serpens Psychic Academy is happy to announce a partnership that would allow G.R.O.W. volunteers and employees to detect the symptoms of MES in children and have them enrolled in the Serpens Psychic Academy as early as possible. Early detection is key, and with A.C.R.E. G.R.O.W., treatment and training will be better available to children who need it.</p>
